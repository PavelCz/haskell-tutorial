# Haskell Tutorial Notebooks

The gist:

- [Lecture website](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/fpv/WS1920/) (with slides)
- To run online upload [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gibiansky/IHaskell/master)
- not standalone, we will go through them in the tutorial
- feel free to ask me questions about the contents
- no warranty

## About the Notebooks

These notebooks were created for my tutorials for the lectue [Functional Programming and Verification](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/fpv/WS1920/) in winter semester 2019/20.

They mainly provide examples, while the explanations are discussed *in class*.

They are not intended to be exhaustive, I will cover the main concepts that will be helpful for the respective exercise.
These notebooks are mainly here as an additional help for understanding the contents of the lecture.
The contents of these notebooks are based on the lecture slides which are available [here](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/fpv/WS1920/index.html).

Trying to learn Haskell with only these notebooks without going to the tutorials is probably not the best way.
Instead there are many good online tutorials to learn Haskell.

These notebooks were created to the best of my knowledge, without guarantee of their correctness.
They are also not an official part of the lecture.
If you find any mistakes feel free to open an issue / pull request, tell me in class or send me an e-mail :) (if you don't remember my e-mail ask me in class).

## How to run the notebooks

These notebooks are Jupyter notebooks for a Haskell kernel. They were created with [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell).

If you click on the notebooks here on Github you will see a static version of the notebook rendered in your browser.
There you can see the contents and code of the notebook, but you will not be able to run any cells directly.

To run them
- follow the instructions in the IHaskell Github repo to install Jupyter with a working Haskell kernel on your local machine
- or use an online instance, such as [this](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gibiansky/IHaskell/master), and upload the notebook.
